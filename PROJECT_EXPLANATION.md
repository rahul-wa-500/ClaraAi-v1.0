# 📖 Clara AI - Project Documentation & Code Guide

Welcome! This guide explains the structure, architecture, and step-by-step code implementation of **Clara AI**. Everything has been organized into a clean, industry-standard React folder structure to stay simple, modular, and easy to maintain while matching your signature dark graphite and neon pink theme.

    │
    └── utils/                   # 📂 HELPER UTILITIES
        ├── chatStorage.js       # Handles browser localStorage for saving & loading chats

        └── aiIdentity.js        # AI persona & identity responses (Rahulwa Designed this Ai)
```

### Why this structure is clean and standard:
1. **`components/`**: All UI components live in one place. Each component has its own dedicated folder containing its `.jsx` logic and `.css` styling paired together.
2. **`services/`**: API calls, network requests, and external AI integrations (e.g., `gemini.js`) live separate from the UI components.
3. **`utils/`**: Generic helper functions (e.g., `chatStorage.js` for `localStorage`) live in their own clean utility folder.
4. **Root of `src/`**: Remains uncluttered with only `App.jsx`, `App.css`, `main.jsx`, and `index.css`.

## 🧩 2. What Each File Does & Code Explanation

### 2.1. `src/utils/chatStorage.js` (Persistent Chat Storage)
**Purpose:** Saves your conversations in the user's browser via `localStorage` so chats are **never lost when you refresh or close the page**.

**Key Functions:**
- `loadChatsFromStorage()`: Reads stored chats from `localStorage`. If no history exists, it safely returns an empty array `[]`.
- `saveChatsToStorage(chats)`: Converts your chat array into JSON and saves it in `localStorage`.
- `getStoredActiveChatId()` / `setStoredActiveChatId(id)`: Remembers which conversation you currently have open.
- `createNewChatObject(title)`: Creates a new chat object structure:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: "chat_172927...",      // Unique ID for the chat
    title: "How to code...",    // Title derived from first prompt
    createdAt: "...",           // Timestamp
    updatedAt: "...",           // Last updated timestamp
    isSaved: false,             // true when you click the star ⭐
    messages: []                // Array containing all conversation messages
  }
  ```

---

### 2.2. `src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx` & `Sidebar.css` (The Sidebar)
**Purpose:** Gives you a modern AI sidebar (like ChatGPT or Gemini) to manage all your chats.

**Features Included:**
1. **Brand Header**: Displays the Clara logo badge `C` and a collapse/close button.
2. **"New Chat" Button**: Click to start a fresh discussion at any time.
3. **Tabs ("Recents" vs "Saved")**:
   - **Recents Tab**: Shows all your conversations sorted chronologically with timestamps.
   - **Saved Tab**: Shows only conversations where you clicked the Star ⭐ button.
4. **Search Bar**: Lets you filter your chat history instantly by typing keywords.
5. **Chat Item Actions**:
   - **Click Chat**: Opens that conversation in the main chat view.
   - **Star Button (⭐)**: Stars or un-stars the chat to bookmark it in "Saved".
   - **Trash Button (🗑️)**: Deletes that individual conversation with confirmation.
6. **Footer**:
   - **Clear History Button**: Allows resetting all past chats with a confirmation alert.
7. **Responsive & Collapsible**:
   - Can collapse smoothly to 0 width.
   - On mobile screens, slides in over an overlay backdrop.

---

### 2.3. `src/components/FormattedResponse/FormattedResponse.jsx` & `FormattedResponse.css`
**Purpose:** Makes Clara's AI responses look clean, readable, and structured instead of raw unformatted text.

**What It Formats:**
- **Code Blocks**:
  When Gemini responds with code (e.g. ` ```javascript ... ``` `):
  - Renders inside a sleek dark code box.
  - Displays the code language badge (e.g. `JAVASCRIPT`, `PYTHON`, `HTML`).
  - Includes a dedicated **"Copy code"** button that copies just that snippet to clipboard.
- **Headings**:
  Translates `#`, `##`, `###` into nicely styled title text.
- **Lists**:
  Converts bullet points (`* item` or `- item`) and numbered lists into neat indented lists.
- **Bold Text & Inline Code**:
  Renders `**bold**` with bold contrast and `` `inline code` `` with a soft gray badge.
- **Copy Response Button**:
  Provides a one-click button at the bottom of Clara's message to copy the entire response.

---

### 2.4. `src/components/Clara/Clara.jsx` & `Clara.css` (Main Chat View)
**Purpose:** Displays the conversation messages, starter cards, loading indicator, and input box.

**Key Elements:**
1. **Chat Meta Bar**:
   - Appears at the top of an active chat showing the chat title, message count, and a quick **"Save Chat"** bookmark button.
2. **Starter Cards (Empty Chat State)**:
   - When you start a New Chat, you are greeted with a welcome message and your signature **3 cards**:
     1. *Learn*: "How neural networks work in simple terms"
     2. *Code*: "React component for a responsive navbar"
     3. *Productivity*: "5 actionable tips for developers"
   - Clicking any card immediately sends the question or starts your chat!
3. **Continuous Conversation Thread**:
   - Preserves the **full conversation thread**!
   - Displays user messages with a pink **"You"** badge.
   - Displays Clara's responses with an AI dot indicator and formatted text.
4. **Loading State**:
   - Keeps your custom loading text: `"Ruko bhai sochne do..."` with animated bouncing dots and a pulsing neon pink dot!
5. **Auto-Scroll**:
   - Automatically scrolls smoothly to the latest message as soon as Clara replies.
6. **Input Box**:
   - Accepts prompt text, submits on **Enter** or on clicking the pink Send arrow button.

---

### 2.5. `src/components/Navbar/Navbar.jsx` & `Navbar.css`
**Purpose:** Top navigation bar.

**Enhancements:**
- Added a **Sidebar Toggle Hamburger Button** on the left. If you collapse the sidebar, you can click this button at any time to reopen it.
- Shows an active conversation pill tag displaying the current chat topic.
- Has a quick **"New Chat"** button in the top menu.
- Fixed layout width to `100%` with blur backdrop to avoid horizontal scrollbar issues.

---

### 2.6. `src/services/gemini.js` (Gemini API Integration)
**Purpose:** Contains the network client that sends prompt text to Google's Gemini models (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3.8-flash`) and returns the generated text answer.

---

### 2.7. `src/utils/aiIdentity.js` (AI Persona & Identity Responses)
**Purpose:** Handles custom, deterministic persona and identity responses before sending queries over the network.

**Key Behaviors:**
- Responds specifically to questions like *"Who are you?"*, *"What is your name?"*, *"Who made you?"*, *"Who designed this AI?"*, *"Who is Rahulwa?"*, and general AI identity queries.
- Ensures Clara reliably replies with: **"My name is Clara and Rahulwa Designed this Ai."**
- Provides fast, offline-capable responses without consuming Gemini API tokens.
- Supports English and Hindi/Hinglish phrasing (e.g., *"tum kaun ho"*, *"tumhe kisne banaya"*).

---

### 2.8. `src/App.jsx` (Application State Coordinator)
**Purpose:** Connects all parts together cleanly.

**How the Data Flows:**
1. Loads `chats` from `localStorage` using `loadChatsFromStorage()`.
2. Manages `activeChatId` (which chat is currently open).
3. When the user sends a message in `Clara`:
   - If it's a new conversation, it generates a new chat object, titles it from the first prompt, adds the user message, and adds it to `chats`.
   - If it's an existing conversation, it appends the user message to that chat.
   - It sets `loading = true`.
   - It calls `generateGeminiResponse(promptText)` from `services/gemini.js`.
   - It appends Clara's answer to the chat's messages.
   - It saves everything to `localStorage` via `saveChatsToStorage()`.
   - It sets `loading = false`.
4. Handles deleting chats, toggling stars/saves, and clearing history.
5. Manages speech synthesis playback state (`activeSpeakingId`), speech settings, and voice modal visibility.

---

### 2.9. 🎙️ Voice & Speech Features (`src/utils/speechService.js` & `VoiceSettingsModal`)
**Purpose:** Provides full Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities for Clara's AI responses.

**Key Capabilities:**
1. **Per-Response Speech ("Listen" / "Stop" Button)**:
   - Each Clara response features a **"Listen"** button alongside the **"Copy"** button in the message action bar.
   - Clicking **"Listen"** begins clear, fluent audio narration of Clara's response.
   - While audio plays, the button transitions to **"Stop"** with an animated pulsing equalizer wave.
   - Clicking **"Stop"** immediately halts speech.
   - Seamlessly cancels previous speech if the user plays another response or switches conversations.

2. **Smart Markdown Text Preprocessing**:
   - Strips code blocks, markdown symbols (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `### headers`, `> blockquotes`, `- lists`, `[links]`) before speaking so Clara never awkwardly recites brackets, hashtags, or raw code syntax.

3. **Chromium Long-Text Sentence Chunking**:
   - Splits long responses into natural sentence chunks to eliminate Chrome's known 15-second utterance pause bug, ensuring uninterrupted narration of long answers.

4. **Global Voice & Speech Options Modal**:
   - Accessible via the **Voice** button in the Navbar and beside the prompt input box.
   - **Auto-Read Responses**: Toggle switch to have Clara automatically speak all new answers out loud as soon as they arrive.
   - **Voice Selector**: Dynamically lists all installed browser/system voices (with natural/English prioritization).
   - **Speech Speed (Rate)**: Slider from 0.7x to 1.5x with quick presets (0.8x Slow, 1.0x Normal, 1.2x Fast).
   - **Pitch Adjuster**: Slider to customize the tone of Clara's voice.
   - **Voice Preview Button**: Lets you preview how Clara sounds with the current settings.
   - Preferences are automatically saved in `localStorage`.

## 🎨 3. Design & Theme Consistency

The application strictly preserves and enhances your original aesthetic:
- **Background:** `linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(27, 27, 27), #141414)`
- **Sidebar & Panels:** `#171717` with subtle `#282828` borders.
- **Accent Color:** Neon pink `#ff006f` for logos, badges, focus outlines, and send buttons.
- **Star Color:** Warm gold `#ffb703` for bookmarked/saved chats.
- **Typography:** Google Font `'Manrope', sans-serif` for clean readability.
- **Interactive Micro-Animations:** Hover lift on cards, pulsing loading dot, smooth sidebar transitions, and copy feedback ("Copied!").
